# About the Project

Nearly thirty years ago, Elinor Ostrom published her groundbreaking book Governing the Commons, in which she showed that users of natural and agricultural resources can and do govern such resources themselves. By making the rules together and complying, 'commoners' can manage their own resources. They don't have to rely on government regulation or corporate policy. They can face challenges and make decisions collectively. Ostrom also extended her work on commons governance to knowledge commons.

Sharing resources, such as data, methods, publications, and curriculum, is one of the foundations of university education and development. But today many academic resources such as subscriptions and the syllabi are managed in rigid, bureaucratic ways. Users often find it difficult to create and share new, openly licensed work in this controlled academic market.

_The main goal of this project is to design and execute learning workshops to empower academics in co-creation of commons-based organisation structures._  
These workshops will introduce you to issues, concepts, and successful examples of academic and nonacademic communities governing common resources. Participants will be involved in applying the concept of commons to concrete cases relevant to academia and knowledge creation, not just by listening, but by doing, together.
